To create conda env:
conda create -n real_time_ml python=3.10.4

Install pipx (to install poetry)
brew install pipx
Install poetry
pipx install poetry

**Actually that didn't work...**
I use this instead:
Within the conda env:
  pip install -U pip setuptools
  pip install poetry

Install Make
brew install make
